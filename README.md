# Game-Expert-System
## Video Game Knowledge Base
This is a Prolog program that contains a knowledge base of popular video games, including their genre, platform, and difficulty level. It also includes a recommendation system that suggests games based on the user's preferred platform, genre, and difficulty level.

## Usage
To get a list of recommended games, simply call the recommend predicate, like so:
`
recommend(Games).
`

The program will then prompt the user to select their preferred platform, genre, and difficulty level. Once the user has provided their preferences, the program will print a list of recommended games that match those preferences.

## Game Knowledge Base
The program's knowledge base includes the following information for each game:

- Game title
- Genre (adventure, action, rpg, open_world, fps, simulation)
- Platform (playstation, nintendo, pc)
- Difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)

## Future Improvements
The program could be improved in a number of ways. For example, it could be expanded to include more games, or it could be enhanced to allow users to specify additional preferences, such as game length, graphics quality, or multiplayer support.
